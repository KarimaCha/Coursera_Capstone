# Coursera_Capstone

This repository contains my Capstone project of the coursera course **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**, which includes the following steps: Data mining, data cleaning, data exploration, k-means clustering, data visualization using Folium.

The aim of this Capstone project was to find the optimal location for opening a new study café in Hamburg by generating a nice visual overview of Hamburg's districts and their relevant characteristics for this new venue on a map. To this end, I collected and combined several data about Hamburg (e.g. rental prices, locations data of universities, venues, and districts) and visualized these data on a geographical map using Folium. Based on this map, some districts were identified that meet the required criteria for the new venue: (1) close proximity to univerisites, (2) low to moderate rental prices, (3) lively area with other food & drink venues, but not too many other cafés yet.

The repository includes:
  - the final Capstone project report in pdf format (Capstone_Hamburg_Report.pdf)
  - the Jupyter notebook of the Capstone project (Capstone_Hamburg.ipynb)
  - 3 additional Jupyter notebooks containing pre-assignments to the Capstone project (Toronto_Part1-3.ipynb)
